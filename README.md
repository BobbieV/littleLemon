This is the code I used to complete the Meta Front End Web Developer certification via the Coursera online education platform.

This code is deployed using Netlify at [

Some notes:

Through the course of this certification, there have been some big learning gaps that I have filled using freeCodeCamp, YouTube and a number of other online learning resources.  This has resulted in some areas that I feel my concepts may be a little patchy-- issues regarding create-react-app being taught despite its deprecated state were challenges that I navigated alone and I may have done so poorly.  This project utilizes TypeScript, where I probably should have initiated the project in JavaScript instead, but I don't know that it's causing any major issues to be running this way.  


I welcome any feedback that can help me learn to build better apps in the future.
